What would the perfect drinks be after?\n","Asked by: M.A. (Age 12)\n","That's a great question! Here's a simple recipe for making crispy fried potatoes:\n","\n","Ingredients:\n","\n","* 2-3 large potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n","* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n","* 1/4 cup cornstarch\n","* 1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs\n","* 1/4 cup butter, melted\n","* Salt and pepper to taste\n","* Vegetable oil for frying\n","\n","Instructions:\n","\n","1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornstarch, and panko breadcrumbs.\n","2. Pour the melted butter into a separate bowl.\n","3. Dip each potato cube into the butter, coating it completely, then roll it in the flour mixture to coat. Place the coated potato on a plate or tray.\n","4. Heat about 1/2-inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it reaches 350°F.\n","5. Carefully place a few of the coated potato cubes into the hot oil and fry for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and crispy. Repeat with the remaining potato cubes.\n","6. Remove the fried potatoes from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n","7. Serve the fried potatoes hot and enjoy!\n","\n","As for drinks, here are some suggestions that go well with fried potatoes:\n","\n","1. Root Beer: A classic pairing that's hard to beat. The sweet, creamy flavor of root beer complements the crispy, savory flavor of fried potatoes perfectly.\n","2. Iced Tea: A refreshing choice that's light and easy to drink. You can choose from a variety of flavors like peach, berry, or lemon to match the flavors of your fried potatoes.\n","3. Lemonade: A sweet and tangy drink that pairs well with the salty, crispy flavor of fried potatoes. You can make it from scratch or use a pre-made mix for a quick and easy drink.\n","4. Beer: If you're looking for something a bit more adult-friendly, beer is a great choice to pair with fried potatoes. Try a light, crisp lager or ale to complement the flavors of your dish.\n","5. Sparkling Water: If you want something bubbly and refreshing without the calories of soda, sparkling water is a great choice. You can add a squeeze of lemon or lime for a bit of flavor.\n","\n","I hope you enjoy making and eating these crispy fried potatoes, and that you find a drink that you like!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from transformers import AutoTokenizer\n","import accelerate\n","import transformers\n","import torch\n","\n","\n","class LlamaInference():\n","    def __init__(self, context_length = 2000, token=\"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\"):\n","        self.model = \"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf\"\n","\n","        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(self.model, token=token)\n","        self.pipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n","            \"text-generation\",\n","            model=self.model,\n","            torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n","            device_map=\"auto\",\n","            token=token\n","        )\n","\n","    def inference(self, input_msg : str) -> str:\n","        sequences = self.pipeline(\n","          input_msg,\n","          do_sample=True,\n","          top_k=10,\n","          num_return_sequences=1,\n","          eos_token_id=self.tokenizer.eos_token_id,\n","          max_length=context_length,\n","          )\n","        return sequences[0]\n","\n","\n","class LlamaAgent():\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Dialouge template:\n","    <s>[INST] <<SYS>>\n","    {{ system_prompt }}\n","    <</SYS>>\n","    [/INST]</s>\n","\n","    {{ user_msg_1 }} [/INST] {{ model_answer_1 }} </s><s>[INST] {{ user_msg_2 }} [/INST]\n","    \"\"\"\n","    def __init__(self, inference_model : LlamaInference, system_msg : str, context_length=2000):\n","        self.context_length = context_length\n","        self.model = inference_model\n","        self.history = []\n","        self.system_msg = f\"<s> [INST] <<SYS>> {system_msg} <</SYS>> [/INST] </s>\"\n","\n","    def message(self, msg : str) -> str:\n","        self.append_user_msg(msg)\n","\n","        context = self.build_context()\n","        answer = self.model.inference(context)['generated_text'][len(context):]\n","        self.append_system_msg(answer)\n","\n","        return answer\n","\n","    def append_user_msg(self, msg):\n","        self.history.append((\"usr\", msg))\n","\n","    def append_system_msg(self, msg):\n","        self.history.append((\"sys\", msg))\n","\n","    def build_context(self)->str:\n","        context = \"\"\n","        maxlen = self.context_length - len(self.system_msg)\n","\n","        for dialoge_idx in range(len(self.history), 0, -1):\n","            sender, msg = self.history[dialoge_idx-1]\n","            if sender == \"usr\":\n","                dialoge = f\"<s>[INST] {sender}: {msg} [/INST] \"\n","            else:\n","                dialoge = f\"{sender}: {msg} </s>\"\n","            dialoge += \"\\n\"\n","\n","            if len(context) + len(dialoge) > maxlen:\n","              break\n","            else:\n","              context = dialoge + context\n","\n","        context = self.system_msg + \"\\n\" + context\n","\n","        return context\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"xGlPykRFVnhP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708192477664,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":431,"user":{"displayName":"Prucs Ákos","userId":"12241478937817497031"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["context_length = 2000\n","model = LlamaInference(context_length)\n","system_msg = \"You play the role of a teacher speaking in the language of a little child.
